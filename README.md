# Customer-Segmentation
## Project Overview
This project aims to help a bank's marketing team launch a targeted ad campaign by segmenting their customers into at least three distinctive groups based on the data collected over the past six months.
The bank has provided us with customer data, and through the use of data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques, we have created customer segments.
These segments can be used to tailor marketing efforts to specific customer groups, thereby increasing the campaign's effectiveness.

## Data Overview
The data provided by the bank contains information about their customers for the past six months. 
The dataset includes various customer attributes, such as age, income, education, and more.
This data serves as the foundation for our customer segmentation analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
Before we can perform customer segmentation, we need to preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. The preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Removing outliers
These steps ensure that the data is clean and ready for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves gaining a deeper understanding of the data through visualizations and statistical analysis.
In this project, we used libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to explore the dataset.
EDA helps us identify patterns, correlations, and insights that may be valuable for customer segmentation.

## Customer Segmentation
The main part of this project involves customer segmentation using the following techniques:

- *K-Means Clustering*: We applied K-Means clustering to group customers with similar characteristics together. We experimented with different values of K to find the optimal number of clusters.

- *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*: To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve the interpretability of clusters, we used PCA.

## Conclusion
In this data science project, we successfully segmented the bank's customers into distinctive groups using K-Means clustering and PCA.
This segmentation will enable the marketing team to launch targeted ad campaigns, improving the bank's marketing strategy and customer engagement.
